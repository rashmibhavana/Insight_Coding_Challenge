To read my code: Open the python file and just press run.

Do before running file: There was the input folder which we had to download and work off of. It was too big to be pushed to GitHub,
so you need to have that input file in the same folder as my code.

That is all that is needed for my code. All other details not regarding the code are explained in the email. Thank you!
